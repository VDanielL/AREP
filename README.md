# AREP
Accompanying repository for the following paper on anomaly detection on network telemetry data: 

_Farkas, K. **AREP**: an adaptive, machine learning-based algorithm for real-time anomaly detection on network telemetry data. Neural Comput & Applic **35**, 6079–6094 (2023)._ [https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-022-08000-y](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-022-08000-y)


### Code
This folder contains the code of the AREP and Alter-Re² algorithms, our data type classification algorithm, and our novel ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve generation algorithm.

### Results
This folder contains the results of our experimentation of comparing AREP to its predecessors and other state-of-the-art algorithms using widely accepted anomaly detection metrics. We also provide the raw data for the ROC curves generated by our novel method.
