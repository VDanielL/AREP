# AREP
Accompanying repository for a paper on anomaly detection on network telemetry data.

### Code
This folder contains the code of the AREP and Alter-ReÂ² algorithms, our data type classification algorithm, and our novel ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve generation algorithm.

### Results
This folder contains the results of our experimentation of comparing AREP to its predecessors and other state-of-the-art algorithms using widely accepted anomaly detection metrics. We also provide the raw data for the ROC curves generated by our novel method.
