### AlterReRe
An older version of our algorithm, detailed in this paper:
https://www.infocommunications.hu/documents/169298/4701582/InfocomJ_2021_1_5_Vajda.pdf

### AREP
Our newest version, that includes performance and ease-of-use improvements.

### DataTypeClassification
An algorithm capable of classifying datasets based on the following two categories: periodicity and spikiness.

### ROCGeneration
Generating the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for deterministic anomaly detectors (capable of only producing anomaly/normal outputs) is not as straightforward as for probabilistic ones. For our class of algorithms, we developed a novel way to still be able to generate an ROC and calculate the AUC metric, included in this folder.
